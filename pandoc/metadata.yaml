title:  'E-ARK Dissemination Information Packages (DIP)'
abstract: |
        The DIP format is the last in sequence of the three IP formats defined
        in the OAIS reference model. As with the two others, the SIP and the AIP
        format, the E-ARK DIP builds upon the same foundation - the Common
        Specification for Information Packages. The definition of an E-ARK DIP
        is led by practical access considerations: a DIP is an Information
        Package which is ready to be processed by its designated Access
        Software; if it is not suited for processing and rendering by its
        designated Access Software, it is not (yet) a DIP.
        In order to meet the stated access scope, much of the specification
        deals with scenario descriptions that are associated with specific
        Content Information Types (Databases, Data warehouses, Electronic
        Records Managements Systems, Simple File-System Based Records, and Geodata).
