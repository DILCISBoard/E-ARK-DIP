III Acknowledgements
----------------
The E-ARK Dissemination Information Package (DIP) Specification was first
developed within the E-ARK project in 2014 – 2017. E-ARK was an EC-funded pilot
action project in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme 2007- 2013, Grant
Agreement no. 620998 under the Policy Support Programme.

Since the scope of the E-ARK 2014-2017 DIP specification was linked to a
reference implementation, specific Content Information Types, and product
development with pilot actions it was a 100 pages long document. The scope of
this E-ARK DIP Specification is not the same, the document has been shortened
heavily and therefore we currently only have two authors credited. This does not
mean that the current authors are the only ones behind this specification. We
rely heavily on the work previously done.

The authors of this specification would like to thank all national archives,
tool developers and other stakeholders who provided valuable knowledge about
their requirements for information packages and feedback to this and previous
versions of the specification.
