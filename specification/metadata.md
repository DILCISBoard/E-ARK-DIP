abstract: |
          This is the extension of the E-ARK CSIP profile for creation of an
          E-ARK DIP. The profile describes the Dissemination Information Package
          (DIP) specification and the implementation of METS for packaging
          OAIS conformant Information Packages. The profile is accompanied by
          a text document explaining the details of use of this profile.
