# **â€‹2 Structure**

The folder structure of an CS DIP must comply with the requirements for the folder structure for an CS IP, see [Folder structure of the CS IP](https://dilcisboard.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/structure/folders/)

The CS IP folder structure and its requirements is visualised in the figure below:

![IP Folder Structure](fig_8_cs_ip_struct.png)

- Green boxes represent folders
- Red boxes represent files. 
- Boxes with full lines represent mandatory files/folders
- Boxes with dotted lines represent optional files/folders. 

As can be seen - the requirements for the folder structure for a CS IP is at a bare minimum and makes it possible to have many optional folders in a CS IP (see boxes with dotted lines). 
As an example CS IP does not require that data exist.


The DIP folder structure can change slightly depending on its content information type. The sections below that deal with the DIP format specifications will reflect these changes.
