# Executive summary

The primary aim of this document is to present the final version of the E-ARK Dissemination Information Package (DIP) formats. The secondary aim is to describe the access scenarios in which these DIP formats will be rendered for use. This document is a revision of the deliverable D5.3 E-ARK DIP Pilot Specification, which was published in May 2016.
The above mentioned pilot version of the DIP formats has been used in the E-ARK pilots that are specific to Access. Feedback from these pilots has been taken into account to amend the specification of the formats where necessary. The results are the present deliverable.
In order to make this specification as operable as possible, it provides the concrete DIP specifications and access scenario descriptions that are associated with the content information types that the E-ARK project has dealt with: Databases, Data warehouses, Electronic Records Managements Systems, Simple File-System Based Records, and Geodata. 
It also provides example metadata files for each content information type by linking to these files on GitHub.
The ultimate aim is to provide fully functional DIPs for each content information type, but this is outside the scope of this milestone deliverable.  
This document is structured according to the specifications and access scenarios of the five aforementioned content information types. This structure has the advantage that each content information type section can stand alone. The drawback is that there are repetitions in each section
ment.** This chapter provides an overview of submission agreement usages and recommended metadata elements.
