# 1. Introduction


## 1.1. Scope and purpose

This document is a DIP specification which is guided by the following model (see Figure 1):

_Common Specification for Information Packages_

Common Specification for Information Packages (CSIP) identifies and standardises the common aspects of information packages (SIP/AIP/DIP) which are equally relevant and implemented by any of the functional entities of the overall digital preservation process (i.e. pre-ingest, ingest, long-term preservation and access). 
CSIP is a separate document. Therefore, the current specification does not aim largely repeating the information presented there â€“ only the information that is absolutely necessary to understand the DIP specification will be mentioned here. 

_SIP, AIP, and DIP Specification_

SIP, AIP, and DIP specifications are in some respects outlined to be "on the same level" in the hierarchical order of specifications,
but there are some cases where the DIP specification heavily relies on what is stated in the SIP and AIP specifications.
This is the current document which describes the DIP package structure and minimum set of required metadata for DIP creation.

_Content Information Type Specifications_

Content Information Type Specificationsare content-dependent specifications which include detailed information on how content, metadata, and documentation for specific content types (for example ERMS or relational databases) can to be handled within the SIP. At the moment, there are 2 such specifications:
	- SMURF ERMS for electronic records management systems (The SMURF profile for ERMS can be found https://github.com/DLMArchivalStandardsBoard/SMURF/tree/master/spec.) 
	- SMURF SFSB for simple file system based records (The SMURF profile for SFSB can be found at https://github.com/DLMArchivalStandardsBoard/SMURF/tree/master/spec.)
